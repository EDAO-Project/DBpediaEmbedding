# DBpediaEmbedding

A repository for generating RDF graph embeddings on RDF graphs using RDF2Vec.

RDF2Vec embedding generation code can be found <a href="https://github.com/dwslab/jRDF2Vec">here</a> and is based on the publication [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.07659">Portisch et al.</a>].

## Generating Embeddings

Run the `run.sh` script that wraps all the necessary commmands to generate embeddings

```
    bash run.sh
```

The script downloads a set of DBpedia files, which are listed in `dbpedia_files.txt`.
It then builds a Docker image and runs a container of that image that generates the embeddings for the DBpedia graph defined by the DBpedia files.

A folder `files` is created containing all the downloaded DBpedia files, and a folder `embeddings/dbpedia` is created containing the embeddings in `vectors.txt` along a set of random walk files.

## Run Time of Embeddings Generation

Generating embeddings can take more than a day, but it depends on the number of DBpedia files chosen to be downloaded. Following are some basic run time statistics when embeddings are generated on a 64 GB RAM, 8 cores (AMD EPYC), 1 TB SSD, 1996.221 MHz machine

- **Total**: 1 day, 8 hours, 52 minutes, 41 seconds
- **Walk generation**: 0 days, 7 minutes, 24 minutes, 36 seconds
- **Training**: 1 day, 1 hour, 28 minutes, 5 seconds
